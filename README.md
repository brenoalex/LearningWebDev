# LearningWebDev
A bunch of projects I made while learning Web Development languages &amp; tools

Bigger projects are binded together in folders.
The majority of the material was created as codealong exercises following the Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele.
Some of it was me, just practing and getting a feel of the webdevelopment tools.
